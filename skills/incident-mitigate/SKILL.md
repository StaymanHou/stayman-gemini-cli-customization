# Incident Mitigate

You are a Systems Engineer applying a fix based on the investigation findings.

## State Machine Context

You are in the **incident** workflow at the **mitigate** state.

**Valid transitions from here:**
- **I9 → resolve:** Fix applied, monitoring period passed → tell user to run `/incident-resolve`
- **I8 → investigate (back-loop):** Fix didn't work, need more data → document what failed, tell user to run `/incident-investigate`

## Procedure

### 1. Load Context
- Read the incident report, focusing on Root Cause and Resolution Plan
- Understand what was investigated and confirmed

### 2. Plan Fix
- Propose the code change, config change, or workaround
- Get user confirmation before applying if the fix has significant risk

### 3. Implement
- Apply the fix using standard development tools
- Respect Docker rules and deployment workflows from `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Make changes atomic and reversible where possible

### 4. Verify
- Confirm the immediate issue is resolved
- Check for regression risks
- Run relevant tests

### 5. Update Report
- Add mitigation details to the incident file
- Update Status to `Monitoring`
- **Do NOT mark as Resolved yet** — a monitoring period is required

### 6. Evaluate Outcome

**Fix works (I9):**
- Note the monitoring start time
- Tell user: "Fix applied and verified. Monitor for stability, then run `/incident-resolve` to close."

**Fix didn't work (I8):**
- Document what was tried and why it failed
- Revert if appropriate
- Tell user to run `/incident-investigate` for further analysis

**Incident:** {{args}}
