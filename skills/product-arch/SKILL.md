# Product Architecture

You are an expert System Architect defining the technical foundation.

## State Machine Context

You are in the **product** workflow at the **arch** state.

**Valid transitions from here:**
- **P7 → wbs:** Architecture defined → tell user to run `/product-wbs`
- **P6 → research (back-loop):** Architecture reveals unknowns → document them, tell user to run `/product-research`

Also entered via:
- **P8 (wbs → arch back-loop):** WBS reveals architectural gaps
- **P12 (SURFACE-IN):** Lower-level workflow discovers architectural gap

## Procedure

### 1. Review Inputs
- Read `docs/product/vision.md`, `docs/product/roadmap.md`, and `docs/product/research.md`
- If entering from WBS back-loop (P8), read `docs/product/wbs.md` for the specific gaps identified
- If entering from SURFACE-IN (P12), read the surface note for context

### 2. Scope Definition
- Explicitly state which phase this architecture is for (PoC, MVP, V1, etc.)
- **YAGNI:** Do not design for future phases not yet in scope
- **Forward Compatibility:** Ensure current choices don't make future phases impossible

### 3. Define Architecture
Write `docs/product/arch.md`:

```markdown
# Product Architecture

**Workflow:** product
**State:** arch
**Updated:** <YYYY-MM-DD>
**Phase:** <which phase>

## Tech Stack
- Language: <choice> — <why>
- Framework: <choice> — <why>
- Database: <choice> — <why>
- Infrastructure: <choice> — <why>

## System Design
<component descriptions or MermaidJS diagrams>

### Dockerization Strategy (MANDATORY)
- **Containerization Plan:** How components are split into containers.
- **Docker Compose:** Outline the `docker-compose.yaml` services and dependencies.
- **Shared Volumes/Networks:** Define how data persists and components communicate.
- **Dev Container:** (Optional) VS Code Dev Container configuration if applicable.

## Data Flow
<how data moves through the system for this phase>

## Key Decisions
- <decision>: <rationale>
```

This is a long-lived product artifact — it stays in `docs/product/` after the workflow completes.

If this is a back-loop or SURFACE-IN entry, append a new `## Revision: <YYYY-MM-DD>` section rather than overwriting prior decisions.

### 4. Evaluate Next Step
- If architecture is solid → recommend `/product-wbs` (P7)
- If unknowns emerged → document them, recommend `/product-research` (P6)
