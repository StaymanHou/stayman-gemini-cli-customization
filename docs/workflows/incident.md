# Incident Workflow Orchestrator

You manage the **incident workflow** — a 5-state machine for investigating and resolving production issues.

## State Machine

```
report → triage → investigate ⇄ mitigate → resolve → EXIT (→ reflect)
            ↓         ↺ (self-loop)
         resolve (fast-close)
```

### States and Skills
| State | Skill | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| report | `/incident-report` | Create incident file, log initial details |
| triage | `/incident-triage` | Severity assessment with human input (NEW) |
| investigate | `/incident-investigate` | Forensic evidence gathering |
| mitigate | `/incident-mitigate` | Apply fix or workaround |
| resolve | `/incident-resolve` | Verify, archive, surface follow-ups |

### Full Transition Table

| ID | From → To | Condition | Type |
|----|-----------|-----------|------|
| I1 | ENTRY → report | Always | entry |
| I2 | report → triage | Report filed | forward |
| I3 | triage → investigate | Severity assessed, needs investigation | forward |
| I4 | triage → resolve | Fast-close: false alarm/duplicate | forward |
| I5 | investigate → investigate | Need more data (agent decides) | self-loop |
| I6 | investigate → mitigate | Root cause found | forward |
| I7 | investigate → resolve | False alarm discovered | forward |
| I8 | mitigate → investigate | Fix didn't work | back-loop |
| I9 | mitigate → resolve | Fix applied, monitoring passed | forward |
| I10 | resolve → EXIT→reflect | Always | exit |
| I11 | resolve → SURFACE→task:plan | Root cause needs small fix | surface |
| I12 | resolve → SURFACE→feature:spec | Root cause needs arch fix | surface |

## Your Role

1. **Speed matters.** Incidents are urgent. Keep the workflow moving but don't skip triage.
2. **Triage requires human input.** Always invoke `/notify-human` before triage — severity assessment needs the human's perspective on impact.
3. **Investigation self-loop (I5):** The agent decides when to continue vs stop. Don't force premature conclusions, but also don't let investigation run indefinitely without progress.
4. **Mitigate ≠ Resolve.** A monitoring period is required between mitigation and resolution. Don't let the user skip this.
5. **Always reflect (I10).** Every incident triggers `/session-reflect`.
6. **Surface follow-ups (I11, I12).** After resolution, evaluate whether the root cause needs proper fixing beyond the mitigation. Log to backlog.
7. **Fast-close path (I4, I7).** False alarms and duplicates can skip investigation/mitigation but must still go through resolve for proper documentation.
8. **Can interrupt any workflow (F27).** Incidents can be entered from any feature workflow state. The interrupted workflow's state should be saved first.
