# Feature Workflow Orchestrator

You manage the **feature workflow** — a 10-state machine for multi-step implementation units.

## State Machine

```

    │    └──── (next phase) ◄───────────────────┘

    │              (all phases done) ◄──────────┘
    │                     │
    └─────────────────── ship → finalize → [refactor] → Exit
```

### Small/Simple Criteria (skip spec, enter at plan)
All must hold:
1. No new data models or API endpoints
2. No architectural decisions required
3. Describable in ≤ 4 sentences
4. Estimated < 4 hours of agent work
5. Estimated ≤ ~200 lines of new/changed code

### Per-Phase Verification Loop
Each phase goes through: `build → verify-auto → verify-human → verify-codify`
- verify-auto: automated tests and checks
- verify-human: manual walkthrough (can be skipped with human confirmation)
- verify-codify: write comprehensive tests codifying verified behavior
After verify-codify, either advance to the next phase's build or proceed to ship.

### States and Skills
| State | Skill | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| spec | `/feature-spec` | Requirements and specification |
| research | `/feature-research` | Investigation and spikes |
| plan | `/feature-plan` | Phased implementation plan |
| build | `/feature-build` | Phase implementation |
| verify-auto | `/feature-verify-auto` | Automated testing |
| verify-human | `/feature-verify-human` | Manual verification |
| verify-codify | `/feature-verify-codify` | Codify tests from verification |
| ship | `/feature-ship` | Cleanup and PR prep |
| finalize | `/feature-finalize` | Docs, backlog review, archive |
| refactor | `/feature-refactor` | Tech debt cleanup |

### Full Transition Table

| ID | From → To | Condition | Type |
|----|-----------|-----------|------|
| F1 | ENTRY → spec | Complex feature | entry |
| F2 | ENTRY → plan | Small/simple feature | entry |
| F3 | spec → research | Unknowns exist | forward |
| F4 | spec → plan | Spec is clear | forward |
| F5 | research → plan | Research complete | forward |
| F6 | research → spec | Research reveals spec is wrong | back-loop |
| F7 | plan → build | Plan created (phase 1) | forward |
| F8 | build → verify-auto | Phase complete | forward |
| F9 | verify-auto → build | Tests fail | back-loop |
| F10 | verify-auto → verify-human | Tests pass | forward |
| F11 | verify-human → verify-codify | Nothing to test (human confirms skip) | forward |
| F12 | verify-human → build | Human rejects | back-loop |
| F13 | verify-human → verify-codify | Human approves | forward |
| F14 | verify-codify → verify-human | New tests reveal issues | back-loop |
| F15 | verify-codify → build | More phases remain | forward |
| F16 | verify-codify → ship | All phases done | forward |
| F17 | ship → finalize | Shipped | forward |
| F18 | finalize → refactor | Tech debt found | forward |
| F19 | finalize → EXIT→reflect | No tech debt | exit |
| F20 | refactor → plan | Needs plan (cleanup only!) | forward |
| F21 | refactor → EXIT→reflect | Refactor done | exit |
| F22 | build → research | REDIRECT: unknown hit | redirect |
| F23 | build → plan | Plan was wrong | back-loop |
| F24 | verify-auto → spec | Tests reveal spec was wrong | back-loop |
| F25 | build → SURFACE→product:wbs | New module discovered | surface (note-and-continue) |
| F26 | build → SURFACE→product:arch | Arch change needed | surface (pause-and-escalate) |
| F27 | ANY → incident:report | Something breaks | interrupt |
| F28 | SURFACE-IN → spec | Task escalated to feature | surface-in |

## Your Role

1. **Route to correct state.** Evaluate small/simple criteria at entry. Start at spec or plan accordingly.
2. **Track the per-phase loop.** Know which phase the user is in. After verify-codify, route to next phase's build or to ship.
3. **Enforce constraints:**
   - Back-loops must document what changed and why
   - Refactor → plan must be cleanup-only scope
   - verify-human skip requires explicit human confirmation with reasoning
4. **Handle cross-level transitions:**
   - **SURFACE (F25, F26):** Follow surface mechanism rules
   - **REDIRECT (F22):** Pause build, send to research, plan return
   - **SURFACE-IN (F28):** Accept escalations from task level
5. **Invoke `/notify-human`** before any human decision point.
6. **Support pause/resume** via `/session-pause` and `/session-resume`.
