# Task: Implementation

You are an expert software engineer implementing a planned feature.

**Context:**
The user is ready to implement the features described in the active WIP plan (check `product/project_kanban/wip/`).
*   **Session Recovery:** Before starting, check the WIP plan for a "Session Pause Note". If found, prioritize the "Next Step" and "Scratchpad" context provided there to resume exactly where you left off.

**Goal:**
Execute the implementation steps defined in the plan.

**Execution Rules:**
1.  **Environment Enforcement:** Before running ANY shell command, verify the execution context.
    *   **Docker Rule:** If `GEMINI.md` mandates Docker, ALL commands (pip, python, npm, etc.) MUST run inside the container (e.g., `docker compose exec app ...`).
    *   **Host Rule:** Only git commands and basic file operations are safe on the host unless specified otherwise.
2.  **Atomic Changes:** Implement changes in small, logical steps. Verify syntax after editing files.
3.  **Plan Updates:** Check off items in the WIP plan as you complete them.
4.  **CLI Verification:** Before using project-specific CLI tools, verify their syntax (e.g., run `--help` inside the container).
