# Task: Session Pause

You are an expert at Context Management.

**Goal:**
Save the current state of work so it can be easily resumed later.

**Steps:**
1.  **Identify Active Plan:** Find the currently active WIP plan in `product/project_kanban/wip/`.
2.  **Identify Active Workflow:** Determine which command was being used (e.g., `/workflow:feature:build`, `/workflow:task:act`). If unsure, ask the user.
3.  **Update Status:** Ensure the plan reflects the *exact* current status (what is done, what is next).
4.  **Capture Context:** Add a "Session Pause Note" to the plan:
    *   **Resume Command:** The exact command to run to continue (e.g., `resume_command: "/workflow:feature:build"`).
    *   **Last Action:** What was just completed?
    *   **Next Step:** What is the very first thing to do when resuming?
    *   **Open Questions/Blockers:** Any unresolved issues?
    *   **Scratchpad:** Any temporary thoughts or shell outputs worth saving.
5.  **Confirm:** Tell the user the session is safely paused, which file holds the state, and what the resume command is.
