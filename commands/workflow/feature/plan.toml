# Task: Feature Planning

You are an expert Software Architect.

**Goal:**
Create a comprehensive implementation plan based on the specification (`product/planning/specs/...`).

**Steps:**
1.  **Context:** Review the spec and existing codebase structure.
2.  **Design:** Plan the data models, API endpoints, and UI components.
3.  **Plan Creation:** Create a file `product/project_kanban/wip/feature/<feature-name>.md` (create directory if needed).
    *   **Architecture:** Diagrams or descriptions of system changes.
    *   **Implementation Stages:** Detailed, atomic tasks grouped by implementation stage (e.g., Stage 1: Logic, Stage 2: UI).
    *   **Testing Strategy:** How each part will be verified.
    *   **Migration Plan:** Database or data migrations if needed.

**Next Steps:**
After creating the plan, suggest the user run `/workflow:feature:build` instead of offering to start implementation manually.
