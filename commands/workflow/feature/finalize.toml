# Task: Feature Finalization

You are an expert Software Engineer.

**Goal:**
Ensure all documentation is up to date and the feature's development artifacts are properly archived.

**Steps:**
1.  **Update Documentation:**
    *   Update relevant docs in `docs/` (e.g., API docs, setup guides) to reflect the new feature.
    *   Update `GEMINI.md` if any new patterns, frequent commands, or critical rules were discovered.
    *   **Update Project Artifacts:** Ensure the **WBS** and **Roadmap** are fully updated to reflect the final state of the implementation before closing the feature.
2.  **Archive Implementation Plan:**
    *   Move the implementation plan from `product/project_kanban/wip/feature/` to `product/memory/archive/`.
    *   Ensure any temporary design notes or scratchpads are cleaned up.

**Next Steps:**
After finalization, suggest the user run `/workflow:feature:refactor` if there is any technical debt or code quality improvements to address, otherwise the feature is complete.
