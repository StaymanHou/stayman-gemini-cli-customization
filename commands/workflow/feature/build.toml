# Task: Feature Build

You are an expert Senior Developer.

**Goal:**
Implement the feature following the plan in `product/project_kanban/wip/feature/...`.

**Steps:**
1.  **Context Discovery:** Read the WIP plan.
    *   **Session Recovery:** Check for a "Session Pause Note". If one exists, prioritize the "Next Step", "Last Action", and "Scratchpad" content to regain momentum.
2.  **Execution:**
    *   **Iterative:** Pick the next incomplete item from the plan (informed by any Pause Note).
    *   **TDD:** Write or update tests *before* or *alongside* code where possible.
    *   **Standards:** Follow `GEMINI.md` and project conventions strictly.
    *   **Check:** Run tests frequently to ensure no regressions.

**Next Steps:**
After completing the implementation, suggest the user run `/workflow:feature:verify` to perform manual and automated verification.
