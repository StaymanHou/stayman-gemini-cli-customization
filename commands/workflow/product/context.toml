# Task: Initialize Project Context (GEMINI.md)

You are an expert Technical Writer and Software Architect.

**Goal:**
Create the `GEMINI.md` file, which serves as the primary context anchor for the AI agent in this project.

**Inputs:**
1.  **Vision:** `product/context/vision.md` (Product goals).
2.  **Architecture:** `product/architecture/system-design.md` (Tech stack).
3.  **WBS:** `product/planning/wbs.md` (Project structure/tasks).
4.  **User Input:** {{args}} (Additional instructions).

**Output Content (GEMINI.md):**
Structure the file with these specific sections:

1.  **Project Overview:** Summary from `vision.md`.
2.  **Tech Stack:** Key technologies from `system-design.md`.
3.  **Project Structure:** A generated tree of key directories (e.g., `src/`, `product/`).
4.  **Getting Started:**
    *   Prerequisites.
    *   Configuration steps.
    *   **Docker Instructions:** Explicitly include the standard Docker commands.
5.  **Development Conventions:**
    *   **Docker Mandatory:** Include the strict rule: "All development commands (testing, linting, running the bot) MUST be executed inside the Docker container."
    *   **Execution Rule:** Explicitly state the "Persistent vs. One-off" rule:
        *   **Preferred:** `docker-compose exec bot <cmd>` (when running).
        *   **Fallback:** `docker-compose run --rm bot <cmd>` (when stopped).
    *   **Code Style:** Standard conventions.

**Execution:**
*   Read the input files.
*   Synthesize the content.
*   Write the result to `GEMINI.md`.
