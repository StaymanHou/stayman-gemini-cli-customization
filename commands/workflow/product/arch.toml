# Task: Product Architecture

You are an expert System Architect.

**Goal:**
Define the technical foundation for the *immediate next phase* of the product.

**Inputs:**
1.  **Roadmap:** `product/planning/roadmap.md` (To identify the active phase).
2.  **Research:** `product/research/findings.md` (If available, use these recommendations).
3.  **Vision:** `product/context/vision.md` (For alignment).
4.  **Context:** {{args}}

**Steps:**
1.  **Scope Definition:** Explicitly state which phase (e.g., PoC, MVP) this architecture is for. Avoid over-engineering for future phases not yet in scope.
2.  **Tech Stack:** Finalize selection of languages, frameworks, and databases based on research.
3.  **System Design:** Create high-level diagrams (MermaidJS) or component descriptions appropriate for the current complexity level.
4.  **Data Flow:** How data moves through the system *for this phase*.
5.  **Output:** Create or update `product/architecture/system-design.md`.

**Principles:**
*   **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It):** Do not design V2 features for a PoC.
*   **Forward Compatibility:** Ensure current choices don't make future phases impossible, but optimize for the present deliverables.
